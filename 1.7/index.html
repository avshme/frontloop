        <p class="article__text">The desire to be respected by someone of the opposite sex is something that runs deep within
          everyone, even though most people don't take the time to find someone who truly respects them. It seems like people
          are just looking for someone to show them the slightest amount of attention, settling for something much less than
          respect. I am convinced one of the best way s to help any relationship grow is by showing respect.</p>
        <p class="article__text">I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected. What is respect? Respect
          is showing someone extra special attention, or high regard, based on a desire to show them how highly they are
          valued.</p>
